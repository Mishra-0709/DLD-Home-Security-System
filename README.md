## Home Security System With Integrated Fire Alarm

- This Multisim project implements a basic home security system logic design.
- The system is designed to monitor various sensors such as door/window sensors, motion sensors,
  and smoke detectors to ensure the security and safety of a home.
- The system utilizes logic gates, flip-flops, timers, and other digital components to control
  alarm activation, sensor monitoring, and user interface.

## Smoke and Heat Detectors
These sensors detect the presence of smoke or fire.

## Control Logic
The control logic consists of combinational and sequential circuits to process sensor inputs and activate alarms based on predefined conditions.

## User Interface
The user interface may include LED indicators, and push buttons for user interaction and system status display.
